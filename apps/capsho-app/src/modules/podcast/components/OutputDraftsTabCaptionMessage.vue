        Your Educational captions are looking a lil blank ðŸ˜…
        because we first need you to click on â€˜Blog Postâ€™ <i>(on the left)</i>
        and confirm your blog post topic.
        Once your blog post is created, your captions will automatically follow.
      </q-card-section>
      <q-card-section>
        <b>Why?</b> Some of these captions reference your blog post
        so we want to make sure all your marketing is consistent
        (and singing from the same song sheet ðŸŽ¶ ðŸ˜Š)
