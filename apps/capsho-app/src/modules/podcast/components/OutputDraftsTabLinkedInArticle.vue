I've grown my agency to multiple locations and dozens of agents, and I'm excited to share the secrets
of the industry's top performers with you. In this episode, I interview Wes Becknell
about how to use data to deliver profitability in trucking insurance.
Trucking insurance is a tough business, but by using data to create a risk profile,
agents can bind rates instantly and email endorsements to their insured with the click of a button.
These time-saving strategies will help agents keep their renewals and make more money in the long run.
<br><br>
Here are the steps you need to follow to also get 1. Exponential growth 2. Increased profitability 3. Improved relationships:<br>
1. Using data to create a risk profile<br>
2. Using technology to bind rates and generate endorsements<br>
3. Using leads to generate new business<br>
<br>
1. Using data to create a risk profile<br>
To create a risk profile using data, insurance agents can use a variety of resources to gather information
on their potential customers. This data can include public records, such as inspection reports and
crash reports, as well as information gathered from the customer themselves. By understanding
where a customer has been and what they have been doing, agents can create a more accurate
picture of the risk they pose. This information can then be used to create a more customized and accurate insurance policy for the customer.<br>
<br>
2. Using technology to bind rates and generate endorsements<br>
To bind rates and generate endorsements using technology, insurance agents can use a site like MCSS Net.
This site allows agents to search for potential customers based on criteria like location,
type of commodity hauled, and number of units. Once a Dot number is entered,
the site will generate a binding rate and provide information on the customer, including any
inspections or crashes that have occurred. Endorsements can be generated and emailed to the customer
instantly, and payments can be collected via Epay policy.<br>
<br>
3. Using leads to generate new business<br>
In order to deliver profitability in trucking insurance, data must be used to create a risk profile.
This risk profile is then used to generate a binding rate that can be emailed to the Insured.
Endorsements are also done instantaneously, and payments can be collected via Epay policy.<br>
<br>
Data is essential for insurance agents who want to grow their business and become more profitable.
By using data to create a risk profile, agents can bind rates instantly and email endorsements to
their customers with the click of a button. These time-saving strategies will help agents
keep their renewals and make more money in the long run.<br>
<br>
Iâ€™m love to hear how you apply to get 1. Exponential growth 2. Increased profitability 3. Improved relationships.
Leave me a comment on how it went for you or drop any questions you want me to answer!`
